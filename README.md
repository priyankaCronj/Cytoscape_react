Layout in Cytoscape. 

In Cytoscape.js, layouts are algorithms that determine the positions of nodes in the graph. Here is a list of some common layout types available in Cytoscape:

Grid Layout (grid): Places nodes in a grid formation.

Circle Layout (circle): Arranges nodes in a circle.

Concentric Layout (concentric): Organizes nodes in concentric circles.

Breadth First Search Layout (breadthfirst): Positions nodes based on a breadth-first traversal of the graph.

Cose Layout (cose): Implements a force-directed layout using the CoSE (Compound Spring Embedder) algorithm.

Cola Layout (cola): Another force-directed layout based on the Cola (Constraint-Based Layout) algorithm.

Random Layout (random): Places nodes at random positions.

Predefined Layout (preset): Allows you to manually specify node positions.

Gridify Layout (gridify): Grid-based layout with automatic adjustment.

Spread Layout (spread): Distributes nodes evenly.

Dagre Layout (dagre): Hierarchical layout using the DAGre (Directed Acyclic Graph) algorithm.

Klay Layout (klay): Another hierarchical layout using the Klay algorithm.

Euler Layout (euler): Implements a force-directed layout using the Euler method.

These layouts provide different ways to arrange nodes in a graph based on specific algorithms or constraints. You can choose the layout that best suits your visualization needs
